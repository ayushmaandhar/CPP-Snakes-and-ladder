# this is a snakes and ladder basic program in cpp
# it uses hardcoded values of 32 numbers less than 100
# There are 8 snakes and 8 ladders in this program
# each snake and ladder is represented by 2 numbers thus 2x8x2 = 32 hardcoded numbers
# It uses rand() which is the core part of the dice in this program
# copy this program and run it in anywhere, its fun to watch it execute.
